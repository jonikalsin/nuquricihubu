On her return to the US, she enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College. She transferred to Stanford University as an English major after her first year. Because she considered Stanford’s drama department’s shows to be “stuffy” and “safe,” she avoided them.</p><h2><span id=Sigourney_Weaver8217s_Origins_and_Ethnicity>Sigourney Weaver’s Origins and Ethnicity</span></h2><p>Sigourney Weaver comes from a wealthy family with a history in filmmaking.
