The athlete, who goes by the name “Mr. Wonderful, was best known for his time in the World Wrestling Federation’s heyday. His son, Travis Orndorff, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> his passing on Instagram today. He was 71.</p><p>“It is with great sadness that I announce the passing of my father, Paul Parlette Orndorff Jr,” wrote the younger Orndorff. “He is better known as ‘Mr. #1derful’ Paul Orndorff.”</p><p>Although Orndorff was known for his impressive build and iconic blond hair, his son wrote that his family loved him outside of the ring as well.</p><p>“Most of you will remember him for his physique,” he wrote. “Many will remember his intensity. But if I could only get you to understand and see his heart. He will always be Pop, Paw Paw and Daddy at home. And as much as many of you hated him as a wrestler, he absolutely loved you for it. He was an amazing father that showed me more than I ever deserved.”</p><p>Orndorff gained popularity as he worked in the southern wrestling circuit, signing with the World Wrestling Federation (which preceded <a href=#>WWE</a>) in late 1983 with “Rowdy” Roddy Piper as his manager. Piper gave him the famed “Mr. Wonderful” nickname.</p><p>He made his WWF debut in 1984, fighting Salvatore Bellomo in Madison Square Garden, soon shooting up to the main event just a month after his first fight. During his first years, he fought Hulk Hogan, Intercontinental Champion Tito Santana, and more. Mr. Wonderful left the WWF in 1988, heading to WCW, where he won the World Television Championship and the WCW World Tag Team Championship.</p><p>Despite his successes and strongman physique, Orndorff battled many injuries during his career. A bad neck injury left to arm atrophy and later forced him to retire in 200. In 2011, he also fought and survived cancer.</p><p>Frequent rival Hogan took to Twitter to remember the wrestling legend. “RIP my brother,love you and thank you for always making me fight for everything in our matches,” he wrote, “heaven just got even more Wonderful,love U4LifeHH”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just got slammed with the Paul Orndorff news,RIP my brother,love you and thank you for always making me fight for everything in our matches,heaven just got even more Wonderful,love U4LifeHH</p><p>— Hulk Hogan (@HulkHogan) <a href=#>July 12, 2021</a></p><p>Other folks from the wrestling community remembered the iconic wrestling star. “WWE is saddened to learn that WWE Hall of Famer ‘Mr. Wonderful’ Paul Orndorff has passed away at the age of 71,” the WWE shared. “WWE extends its condolences to Orndorff’s family and friends.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>WWE is saddened to learn that WWE Hall of Famer “Mr. Wonderful” Paul Orndorff has passed away at the age of 71.</p><p>WWE extends its condolences to Orndorff’s family and friends.<a href=#>https://t.co/dtWZHJk3x3</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>July 12, 2021</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Damn.
