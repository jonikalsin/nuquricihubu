However, the pair moved on and Alex married Stine Schyberg, and Kelly married and gave birth to a daughter Stellah from her second marriage. Her new partner’s name is Baron Rogers.</p><p>The designer splits up with the drummer, but she never leaves Van Halen, not the band member, but his surname, which is the reason Alex Van Halen sued her. The entrepreneur improved her company by using an already well-known brand name, Van Halen. Before her ex filed a court lawsuit against her in October 2013, she was about to trademark this name. According to the singer, if Kelly Van Halen uses their name, it would confuse their fans and their business. It took three years to settle outside of the courtroom. All parties agreed that Kelly Carter should never trade for something related to music, and she is now free to use the company name for other products.</p><h2><span id=Kelly_Van_Halen_8211_Body_Measurement>Kelly Van Halen – Body Measurement</span></h2><p>Kelly stands at <strong>5 feet 4 inches</strong> tall and weighs around 56 Kg.
