I write like I feel that day. I’m just being creative. You couldn’t build a jail high enough for the lyrics I’ve said on songs which are all untrue.</p><p>“What I am is a family man, the person who gives back to my community all the time, opens businesses in my community. So the music would never amount to the actual person, Joseph Cartagena.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued: “What’s even more horrible is that the district attorneys, they know those lyrics ain’t real. They know that’s creativity. But if it helps their case, they’ll use it to put these guys in jail.</p><p>“And here, we’re having a fun show about it and discussion, but there really is six defendants in Atlanta who might spend the rest of their lives in jail for something that’s totally not true. This is very serious. This destroys families.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/assets/prod/icons/youtube-play.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.youtube.com/vi/p1TK8Vzq0Zk/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Fat Joe also warned that the YSL RICO case sets a worrying precedent as Young Thug is the first artist of his stature to have his own lyrics used against him in court.</p><p>“This case right here is setting such a precedence in America because they’ve used this before in up-and-coming, aspiring artists — they’ve never took a guy off the stage in the arena,” he said.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“You know, a No. 1 artist that my daughter and all the kids look up to, and say, ‘No, you going on trial for this.’ It’s nasty work, it’s real nasty work.”</p><p>In November, Atlanta Journal-Constitution‘s Jozsef Papp <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>revealed some of the lyrics that could be used against Young Thug</a> in the trial.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/11/fat-joe-reveals-hilarious-origin-story-of-his-misleading-joey-crack-moniker-250x142.jpg alt="Fat Joe Reveals Hilarious Origin Story Of His Misleading Joey Crack Moniker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Fat Joe Reveals Hilarious Origin Story Of His Misleading Joey Crack Moniker</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>November 27, 2023</p></a><p>The lyrics include: “I just beat a murder rap, paid my lawyer 30 for that/ Me and my slimes above the law,” from 2018’s “Just How It Is” and “Honestly truth be told YSL won’t fold/ Pick his ass off from the balcony/ YSL wipe a n-gga nose,” from 2014’s “Eww.”</p><p>Upon hearing of the judge’s decision to allow rap lyrics to be used as evidence in the courtroom, fellow Atlanta rapper <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Killer Mike admitted the development “scares” him.</a></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“This decision scares me.
