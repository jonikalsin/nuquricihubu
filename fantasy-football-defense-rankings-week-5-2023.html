Which&nbsp;fantasy football defense will reign supreme in the rankings for Week 5?</p><p>Can the Dallas Cowboys defense stay hot and finally turn Brock Purdy over? Can the <a href=# rel=noopener>Baltimore Ravens</a> defense feast on a reeling Steelers team with question marks at quarterback? Will the New York Jets defense ride against Russell Wilson and Broncos country?</p><p>We'll answer all those questions and more in the fantasy football defense rankings, but first, let's get to the deep sleepers and viable fantasy defense streaming options for Week 5.</p><h3><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>Streaming Week 5 DEF options</strong></span></h3><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Detroit Lions</a> (vs CAR):&nbsp;</strong>The Lions have one of the most <a href=# rel=noopener>underrated defensive</a> units in football, as they've allowed 20 or less points in three of their four first games and rank first in the NFL against the run. If the Panthers get down early on the road, Aidan Hutchinson will get to pin his ears back against a rookie quarterback who doesn't have receivers who are creating separation. That sounds like a recipe for fantasy points to me.</p><p><strong>Miami Dolphins (vs NYG):&nbsp;</strong>If you watched (or were subjected?) to Monday Night Football, you'll understand why the Dolphins are a must-start this week. Daniel Jones was sacked <a href=# rel=noopener>ten times</a>, threw a pick-six, threw another interception, and lost a fumble. We're going to back to the well against this shoddy offensive line and a quarterback who looks spooked.</p><h3><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>Favorite Week 5 FanDuel DFS plays</strong></span></h3><p><strong>New York Jets (@ DEN) – FD $4200:&nbsp;</strong>This is a surprising price on FanDuel, as the Jets are just the 8th highest-price defense on FanDuel on the main slate, despite doing a very admirable job in their last game against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. With Zach Wilson showing signs of life, the Jets defense should be in better positions to get stops. Denver's offense has been very good so far this season, but the Jets' pass defense has held explosive offenses like Buffalo, Dallas, and Kansas City all under 250 passing yards. Take the discount on one of the league's best fantasy defensive units.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>New Orleans Saints</a> (@ NE) – FD $4000:&nbsp;</strong>Here's another price that doesn't make a lot of sense. The Patriots were just shelled by the Cowboys 38-3 and made a quarterback change in the second half and are averaging just 13 points per game on the season. The Saints slipped up last week against the Buccaneers, but this feels like a “get right” spot against a Patriots offense that has no teeth.</p><h3><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>Week 5 Fantasy Football Defense Rankings</strong></span></h3><p><strong>1.
