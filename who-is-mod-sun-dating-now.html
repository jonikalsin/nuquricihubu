Avril shared the happy news on Instagram, along with a cute photo of the proposal, which revealed he got down on one knee in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.</p><p>“Oui! “Je t’aime Toujours,” she wrote in the caption, which translates to “Yes! “I love you forever and ever,” she wrote alongside the date they got engaged, March 27th.</p><p>“It was the most perfect, romantic proposal I could ever ask for,” the 37-year-old told People. We were on a boat on the Seine River in Paris.”</p><p>“There was a violinist, champagne, and roses.” “It felt like time had stopped, and it was just the two of us in the moment,” she went on.</p><p>Fans are now wondering who else Mod Sun has dated in the past. Did he have a relationship with Tana Mongeau, an Internet personality?

The rumors surfaced just a few months after the internet sensation ended her marriage to Jake Paul. They were seen hanging out together and posting numerous photos on social media in which they appeared to be completely smitten. However, they never officially confirmed it, and it seemed to fade away by the end of the year.</p><h2>Bella Thorne Dated Tana Mongeau And Mod Sun At The Same Time</h2><p>Tana and Mod Sun met a few years ago through an unlikely polyamorous relationship. Bella Thorne, an American actress, and model confirmed her relationship with Tana in 2017 and shared their happy relationship with the public. Then, a month later, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, the model revealed that she was also dating Mod Sun at the time, but Tana was not dating Mod Sun.</p><p>Bella, on the other hand, clearly brought them together, as the pair grew closer after she split from both Mod Sun and Tana.</p><p>“Obviously, dating two people at the same time is a little difficult,” she told Cosmopolitan in November 2019. If you’re going to date a guy and a girl at the same time, those two have to f**k with each other.”</p><p>“Or just f**k with each other.” You understand what I mean? “It’s like, it really depends on finding the right mesh of two people,” she went on, implying that Tana and Mod Sun had always been close.</p><p>“It’s a really fun experience and I have been able to capture that a couple of times, and I just love that idea. I love loving two people at once. I love sharing stories with three people in one room,” she continued.</p><h2>Mod Sun Started Dating Avril Lavigne</h2><p>Around a year after breaking up with Bella Thorne in April 2019, Mod Sun found love with singer Avril Lavigne. The pair began dating in early 2020 when they collaborated on her track Flames. A source exclusively told E! in February 2021:</p><p>“Working together has brought them closer and Avril has a history of falling for people that she works with. She falls in love with them for their musical creativity and expression. Her working relationships often turn romantic.”</p><p>They sparked dating rumors when they were spotted at Los Angeles’ BOA Steakhouse together. The 37-year-old then confirmed to PEOPLE in April that they “had an immediate connection from the first day in the studio”.</p><p>The pair formed an instant connection and Mod Sun even got Avril’s name tattooed on his neck really early on in the relationship. Now, they’re engaged and seem happier than ever.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuuc6dZKytnmKxosDIp55mpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jenny-balatsinou.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jenny Balatsinou</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./timothy-b-schmit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Timothy B.
