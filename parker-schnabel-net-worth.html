Everything that happens is moved by hand, almost. Though there are some excavators.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Parker Schnabel</strong></p><p>“The toughest thing is that it’s very seasonal work and we basically have four months to make a year’s worth of money, not only is it difficult but it is also dangerous because everybody is working long hours, long days … from a safety standpoint, that’s risky.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Parker Schnabel</strong></p><p>“I don’t know, you just kind of get focused on working and most of the time it doesn’t bother you too much. If I need to let some steam off I have a dirt bike and I go for a ride. I love riding my bike.”&nbsp;<strong>– Parker Schnabel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I’d say overall the first time I went out to Dawson was really enjoyable and getting to know everyone there. It’s just a wonderful mining community that’s made up of some of the best people in the world and I’m really glad to have become, or feel like I’m becoming a part of that.”&nbsp;<strong>– Parker Schnabel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“There are some big problems on the horizon, some pretty big headwinds are coming. I think it’s a great season of the show and it’s definitely going to be interesting.”&nbsp;<strong>– Parker Schnabel&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>2 Strong Lessons From Parker Schnabel</h2><p>After learning everything there is to know about Parker Schnabel’s net worth and his path to success, let’s look at some of the most important things we can learn from him.</p><h3>1.
