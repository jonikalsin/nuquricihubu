As a mother of four amidst the coronavirus pandemic, the $2 million prize appeared to be a godsend. It was sadly anything but, as her new husband soon turned abusive — then shot Hill and her one-year-old daughter to death before turning the gun on himself.</p><p>Hill had won her fortune with a California scratch-off ticket, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to</a> People. A newfound millionaire, she and her 42-year-old partner John Donato decided to tie the knot and move to Oklahoma, as a result. Donato became abusive shortly after, with Hill telling her family she planned to leave him. On July 30, it was all over.</p><p>Californians first learned her name on Nov. 13, 2020, as the state lottery announced Tiffani Hill’s lucrative break in a glowing press release.</p><p>“The tide has also turned for Tiffani Hill who won an incredible $2 million prize on an Instant Prize Crossword Scratchers,” it read. “That ticket was purchased at Valley Springs Mini Mart, which is located at 33 State Highway 26 in Valley Springs (Calaveras County). The lucky retailer, in this case, earns a bonus of $10,000.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-338806 alt="Tiffani Hill And Leanne Donato" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiffani-hill-and-leanne-donato.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-338806 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>GoFundMe</span><span class=caption-body>Leanne Donato was 23 months old.</span></p><p>Hill only married Donato a few months later, with her newfound fortune rapidly becoming a disturbing point of contention. According to Hill’s own mother, that verbal conflict began to escalate and evolve into domestic abuse. While the protective mother of four had begun planning to leave Donato, things came to a fatal head.</p><p>“Tiffani never reached out to me about anything of that nature,” said family attorney Theresa McGehee, “but I did speak with her mom. And her mom wants the message that Tiffani was trying to get away from it.”</p><p>Arriving at the Choctaw Road residence in Calera, Oklahoma, shortly before 5 p.m., the Calera Police Department and FBI found Donato dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. <a href=# rel=noopener>According to</a> Law and Crime, 31-year-old Hill was killed immediately, while 23-month-old Leanne was reported dead the following Monday.</p><p>“Could that [lottery winning] have sparked that argument?” McGehee said. “We’ll never have any way of knowing. But I do know there were times it caused conflict between them.”</p><p>While the Calera Police Department was first to arrive at the crime scene, the FBI took matters over when a member of the Choctaw Nation was found to be involved. Law enforcement hasn’t disclosed the Indigenous person’s identity or relevance to the murder-suicide.</p><p>Leanne Donato was still alive when authorities arrived and immediately airlifted to a Dallas hospital via helicopter. Perhaps most harrowing of all was that officials found Hill’s surviving three children in the house. While now safely in state custody, they heard their mother and sibling being shot and perhaps saw it happen.</p><p>“She was such a kind-hearted, beautiful person,” Hill’s sister Jamie Kern <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> KTEN. “She loved her kids dearly. She would barely let them out of her sight. Her main goal in this world was to try and make a difference.”</p><p>Ultimately, the Hill family is at an utter loss for words — save for those urging victims of domestic violence to speak up before it’s too late. As for the motherless children left behind, the family has <a href=# rel=noopener>organized</a> a crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe to provide for their future. As for the couple’s money, it will go toward a trust fund.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-338808 alt="Tiffani Hill And Smiling Daughter" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tiffani-hill-and-smiling-daughter.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-338808 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>GoFundMe</span><span class=caption-body>Hill and one of her young daughters who is now in state custody.</span></p><p>“Most of all, Hill’s family wants other domestic violence victims in peril to learn from her tragic death,” McGehee <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> Mirror. “There are resources that people don’t reach out for. She hopes somebody’s listening and will think this could be me next, this could be me and my child.”</p><p>“Tiffani was trying to make arrangements with her family. I wonder if this would have had a different outcome had she reached out to the crisis center.”</p><p>McGehee noted that a period of separation is, statistically, the most dangerous time for anyone experiencing domestic violence. She commended Hill for opening up to her family, although ultimately that wasn’t enough.</p><p>After reading about the Oklahoma man who murdered his wife and daughter, learn about <a href=#>the man who killed his wife on a cruise ship</a> because “she would not stop laughing at me.” Then, read about <a href=#>the Minnesota man who threw a methamphetamine-fueled “death party” for his dying wife</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1tcWfmKehXZ22rbg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./liste-qui-sont-les-blogueuses-tunisiennes-les-plus-influentes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Qui sont les blogueuses tunisiennes les plus influentes ?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mikael-persbrandt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mikael Persbrandt Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
