I’ve been hard on Vishal’s man-child personality since, really, day one, but he does seem genuinely in love with Richa and at a loss for what to do to move forward and mend the broken pieces of their relationship. Tonight’s episode finally gives them the screen time needed to dive into the minutiae of their struggles and address the problems head-on.</p><p>But before we get to any type of reconciliation, everyone has to discuss the aftermath of Reshma Aunty’s dramatic exit from happy hour at the Patel compound. Kalpna Aunty calls Reshma Aunty to ensure she isn’t still harboring ill feelings, and Reshma Aunty holds her ground in saying that she doesn’t want to get involved with their kids’ drama. She even makes it a point to say that if everyone here is “near and dear” in the community, everyone should see each others’ children as their own. It’s a sentiment that hit home for me, especially in minority communities where family friend groups are often closer than actual family.</p><p>Meanwhile, Anisha is living life after her egg extraction and has finally decided to start dating again (during COVID, that too). Last season we found out that Anisha walked away from a long-term relationship, and this week we found out that she’s only gone on approximately ten dates in the nearly three years since the break-up. Honestly…I’m impressed at her willpower.</p><p>For Anisha’s first foray back into dating, she goes on a FaceTime date with a man named Anish. (As a side note, I’ve met Anish through friends at a comedy show in NYC, which literally just proves that brown town is too damn small.) Anyway, it seems like they have a love connection as Anish jokes about having four kids with Anisha and that their kids will be confused by their similar names. It’s cute if not a little cringe, but it makes me happy to see Anisha putting herself out there again, even if the date is likely happening with someone who doesn’t live in Miami and might not actually have a real future right now.</p><p>Monica Vaswani gets a bit more face time this week, taking it upon herself to plan the big gathering of the week: an outdoor Navratri puja and party for the gang. Navratri is a Hindu celebration that symbolizes Goddess Durga’s triumph over a demon, and is celebrated over the course of nine nights (“nav” means nine and “ratri” means nights. Boom, now you’re cultured). However, it seems the celebration of good over evil doesn’t extend to the guest list because Monica is still holding a grudge, and her nemesis Anisha and her family don’t make the cut.</p><p>Of course, Monica–and probably most of the other kids–aren’t as concerned about the religious aspects of the holiday. The main attraction for her is a garba dance, which is performed in a circle, and Monica is quick to remind her dad that she placed first in a competition a few years ago. After some dancing, the scene zeroes in on Vishal and Richa who finally seem to be taking a few steps forward after seemingly being on the brink of breakup. Earlier in the episode, Vishal and Richa sat down for a very real conversation about the path forward, which I felt was a healthy first step. It was apparent that they weren’t hearing each other, weren’t in sync with what happiness looked like for their partner.</p><p>But at the party, Vishal finally makes inroads with Richa’s mom Lopa Aunty, which has been the biggest sticking point in their relationship to date. I did like that Richa pointed out that Lopa Aunty buying a condo in Miami was more in preparation to be closer to her daughter and son-in-law rather than any type of spite towards Vishal. It seems so obvious in hindsight.</p><p>I’ve been hot and cold on Richa and Vishal mainly because it’s not clear to me whether they <i>should</i> be together. Richa can be very dismissive of Vishal’s attempts, while Vishal’s immaturity frustrates me on behalf of Richa. But this episode finally started to show the fun side of their relationship and why they love each other. And goddamn it, I’m rooting for these crazy kids!</p><p><strong>Other Observations:</strong></p><ul><li>This episode had some great one-liners. Bali was missing from the episode because she refused to go to an outdoor party. Her exact words were, “Wearing an Indian outfit on the sand? …No.” I respect the hell out of it.</li><li>Richa exclaimed, to absolutely no one in particular, that her “mustache is sweating.” Brown girls everywhere FELT that.</li><li>This is week three of <i>Family Karma</i> teasing Amrit’s coming out to his Nani. I’m anticipating that to be a big moment of catharsis, but I want it to happen already!</li><li>Speaking of Amrit, I enjoyed that he and his dad went to a gun range as a bonding activity. Neither of them had shot a gun and neither of them want to ever again. I’ve done this with my brother and I can confirm that it is both a very fun and very scary activity.</li><li>Monica and Brian met up to eat Taco Bell (a perfect hangout). But Brian makes a comment about Monica’s relationship being two years deep compared to his at six months. If that’s true, was she dating her boyfriend Rishi during the filming of the first season? Is everything a lie? Stay tuned, Forensic Scientist Radhika Menon is on the case.</li><li>Next week is Halloween, and another Anisha/Monica tussle seems to be in our future. Maybe it’s just me but I don’t really care about their drama, though the producers keep dropping hints.</li></ul><p>Radhika Menon (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@menonrad</a>) is a TV-obsessed writer based in New York City.
