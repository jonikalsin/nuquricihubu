As a result, there is concern about his availability for the upcoming game against the New England Patriots in Week 14. In this article, we will explore the details surrounding Pickett's injury, the expected duration of his absence, and the impact it may have on the Steelers' playoff hopes.</p><h2>Pickett's Injury and Surgical Procedure</h2><p>According to reports from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Kenny Pickett injured his ankle during the game against the Cardinals. The severity of the injury prompted the need for surgery, which Pickett underwent on Monday morning. The surgical procedure aimed to accelerate the healing process and aid in his recovery.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Expected Duration of Absence</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Following the surgery, Pickett is expected to be out of action for a period of 2-4 weeks. This timeframe provides an estimate for his recovery and return to the field. However, it is important to note that the actual duration of his absence will depend on how well he responds to treatment and rehabilitation.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Impact on the Steelers' Offense</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Pickett's absence poses a significant challenge for the Pittsburgh Steelers' offense. Prior to his injury, Pickett had been the team's starting quarterback, leading the offense in their pursuit of a playoff spot. However, with Pickett sidelined, the Steelers turned to backup quarterback Mitch Trubisky to fill the void.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Trubisky, who has appeared in three games this season, has shown promise as a capable replacement. While his statistics are not as impressive as Pickett's, Trubisky has completed 29 of his 49 passes for 273 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions. His experience and familiarity with the team's offensive system make him a suitable option to lead the Steelers' offense in Pickett's absence.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Signing of Trace McSorley</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>To provide additional depth at the quarterback position during Pickett's absence, the Pittsburgh Steelers have signed quarterback Trace McSorley to the practice squad. McSorley will serve as an insurance policy in case of any further injuries or setbacks at the quarterback position. While McSorley may not see immediate playing time, his presence ensures that the Steelers have a backup plan if needed.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Playoff Implications</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>With the AFC playoff standings becoming increasingly competitive, the Pittsburgh Steelers cannot afford to falter in Pickett's absence. The team's upcoming game against the New England Patriots carries significant playoff implications. A win would bolster their chances of securing a playoff spot, while a loss could potentially derail their postseason aspirations.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Steelers' offense will need to rally behind Trubisky and find ways to compensate for the absence of their starting quarterback. The success of their running game and the performance of their defense will be crucial in determining the outcome of the game.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kenny Pickett's ankle injury has forced him to undergo surgery and will keep him out of action for 2-4 weeks. The Pittsburgh Steelers will rely on backup quarterback Mitch Trubisky to lead the offense during Pickett's absence. The team has signed Trace McSorley to the practice squad as a precautionary measure. The upcoming game against the New England Patriots carries significant playoff implications for the Steelers, who must find a way to overcome the absence of their starting quarterback and secure a win to stay in the AFC playoff standings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBlnZa7unnWnpykq12ewG63xKelsmWgnrCssdOtZKitpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./landon-austin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Landon Austin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./magdeburg-germany-chariot-burial.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>6,000-Year-Old Neolithic Burial Complex Discovered In Germany</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
