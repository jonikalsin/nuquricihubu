Being a rock musician John Rzeznik is cautious on his looks and how he appears in front of people. Although he has never confessed of undergoing any plastic surgery, he seems to have different looks altogether, and fans can’t help it but notice the sudden change in the appearance of his nose and chin. Speculations are rife that he has gone several times for the surgery, including rhinoplasty, Botox, shots, and facelifts. His previous and current photos provide enough evidence of this.</p><p>A comparison between his past and current photos shows that he was having a large nose and a broad foundation. His contemporary images show a famous nose bridge that is equally sharped from top to bottom without a comprehensive foundation; a typical indication of rhinoplasty.</p><p>Facelift plastic surgery is common among the superstars in Hollywood. The images of his brow, which used to appear very dissimilar at first, indicate evidence of face lifting as it is seen as having many filler features that make his face seem organized.</p><p>John Rzeznik is also believed to have a chin modification which changes the form and arrangement of the face. Besides this, his appearance nowadays seems to be of a wrinkleless face a typical indication of plastic surgery.
