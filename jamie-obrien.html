Jamie has stated that conversing with a significant number of regular surfers on his father’s ocean side was something that started his advantage in surfing. Jamie has an impressive list of accomplishments. Among these accomplishments is his fourth-place finish at the Pipeline Masters in 2001, following a crotch injury.</p><p>This doesn’t stop there; he also won Hansen’s Pipeline Pro in 2003, Fosters Expression Trestles in 2004, and Rip Curl Pipeline Master in 2004.

He has also collaborated with several other professional surfers, including Poopies and Ben Gravy. Poopies briefly appeared in Jamie’s video blogs before launching “The Poopies Channel.” They’re still old friends who should get together sooner rather than later. The other young men generally look for mischief, such as riding goliath waves on love seats.</p><p>He can be found on his Catch Surf or Tokoro sheets when he isn’t sitting on a sofa riding massive lines. His exceptional moves and ideas have changed people’s perceptions of delicate top sheets and drawn a lot of attention to his support, Catch Surf.
