Demsey was acquired by Lauder in 1991. The former has been an executive group president of the firm since 2015. WWD obtained an internal document mentioning John’s unpaid absence. According to the memo:</p><p>“John Demsey has been put on unpaid leave effective immediately owing to material uploaded on his Instagram account.” The provided material does not reflect The Estée Lauder Companies’ values. As a firm that is genuinely devoted to inclusive activities and conduct, and in accordance with our corporate regulations, our workers and management are held responsible for following these principles.”</p><h2>What was John Demsey’s inconvenient post about?</h2><p>Demsey used the N-word in a contentious Instagram post. According to The Wall Street Journal, the cosmetics behemoth’s executive president tweeted improperly, including a joke about COVID-19. The center, which has since been removed, was a meme depicting a mock-up of a book cover featuring Sesame Street icon Big Bird with a photoshopped mask. On Instagram, John presently has over 73,000 followers. Estée Lauder, on the other hand, did not issue a statement detailing the cause for the executive’s suspension. According to a source, the board of directors of the cosmetics behemoth met on Tuesday to examine Demsey’s appointment.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/John-Demsey-3.jpg alt="John Demsey" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Find out more about John Demsey.</h2><p>John is a divorced father with an adolescent son.
