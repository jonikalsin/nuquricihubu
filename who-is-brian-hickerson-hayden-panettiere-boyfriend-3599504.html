The Heroes actress, 30, stated, “I am coming forward with the truth about what happened to me with the hope that my story will empower others in abusive relationships to get the help they need and deserve. I am prepared to do my part to make sure this man never hurts anyone again.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“I’m grateful for my support system, which helped me find the courage to regain my voice and my life,” she wrote.&nbsp;Brian’s bail is set at $320,000, according to his arrest report, which <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> obtained. Here’s what else you need to know about Brian.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>ORIGINAL:</strong><span> Actress</span><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b> Hayden Panettiere</b></a><span>‘s boyfriend,</span><b> Brian Hickerson</b><span>, </span><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was arrested</a><span> on felony domestic violence charges after allegedly getting into a physical altercation with the </span>Nashville<span> star. Hayden and Brian, both 28, who have been dating for less than a year, have appeared incredibly close since their relationship began. Unfortunately, he was accused of hurting Hayden. Learn more about Brian as the case continues to unfold:</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>1. Hayden and Brian started dating in July 2018.</strong> The couple was apparently set up by mutual friends, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hit it off instantly</a>. This was just around the same time that Hayden split from her fiancé, Ukrainian heavyweight <strong>Wladimir Klitschko</strong>, the father of her daughter, <strong>Kaya Klitschko</strong>. Though they announced their breakup in August 2018, Hayden and Wladimir reportedly had problems stretching back to 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/brian-hickerson-5-things-mega-embed-1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>2. He is an actor and real estate agent. </strong>Brian is from South Carolina, but moved to Los Angeles shortly before getting with Hayden. He moved across the country to pursue acting. Thus far, he has only acted in one project, per IMDb, a film called M.F.A. In the film, which starred <strong>Francesca Eastwood</strong> (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Clint Eastwood</strong></a>‘s daughter) and <strong>Clifton Collins</strong>, Brian played a character called Officer Williams. When he’s not acting, Brian is a real estate agent. In South Carolina, he was self-employed at a company called Hickerson Property. It’s unclear where he works now.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>3. He defended her parenting after she was called out online. </strong>After a report claimed Hayden didn’t have a relationship with her four-year-old daughter, and that she lived in Ukraine with her father, Brian leapt to her defense. He said in a statement to Access Hollywood at the time, “Hayden is actually on a family vacation right now with her daughter and the Champ, so don’t believe everything you read. She’s a great mom.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/brian-hickerson-5-things-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>4. He once dated Baskin Champion. </strong>Hayden isn’t Brian’s only famous significant other. He also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dated Instagram model</a> <strong>Baskin Champion</strong>, who was once memorably linked to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>. Brian and Baskin’s relationship came before the Justin rumors started.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>5. He was arrested on domestic violence charges in May 2019. </strong>Brian was arrested and booked on felony domestic violence charges after an altercation between himself and Hayden allegedly turned physical. The couple apparently went out drinking in Hollywood on May 1, went back to her apartment, and started arguing, according to TMZ. Law enforcement sources told TMZ that police were called to her apartment around 2:00am on May 2, where they apparently saw “redness and marks on Hayden’s body.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/brian-hickerson-5-things-splashnews-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>After interviewing the couple, they determined that Brian started the altercation, and arrested him. He was released on a $50,000 bond later that day. Police confirmed to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that Brian was arrested, but would not say if Hayden was the alleged victim.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>For anyone affected by abuse and needing support, call 1-800-799-7233, or if you’re unable to speak safely, you can log onto <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>thehotline.org</a> or text LOVEIS to 1-866-331-9474.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kvs7XAp2ShoZOgsrO%2FzqdkoZmpmbKvec%2BapZ6spJ6ys7GMm6aynqKesq%2BwjGxscnFlZYFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alyssa-shouse.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alyssa Shouse - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./peter-kellogg-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Peter Kellogg Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
