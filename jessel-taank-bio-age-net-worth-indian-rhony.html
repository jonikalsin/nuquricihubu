Her talent as a fashion publicist and brand consultant helped her </span><span>thrive in one of the most electric cities in the world and eventually landed her a place in RHONY.</span></p><p><span>This Jessel Taank Bio explores her life.</span></p><h3><b>Jessel Taank On RHONY</b></h3><p><span>Season 14 of </span><i><span>Real Housewives of New York City</span></i><span> is on its way, and we already have the list of seven dynamic women including Jessel Taank who have made their mark in NYC.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>These housewives — who’ve delved into fashion and real estate to philanthropy and social influence — first revealed themselves at a </span><i><span>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen </span></i><span>taping during BravoCo.</span></p><p><span>As per its executive producer Andy Cohen, Bravo (this season) was looking for a cast that better reflected New York City. It will follow “an all-new group of seven dynamic women who run in the same social circles, thriving in one of the most diverse and electric cities in the world. From fashion and real estate to philanthropy and social influence, these women have made their mark in NYC and will now share their lives as they juggle careers, family life, and jam-packed social calendars in the city that never sleeps.”</span></p><p><span>The show’s bound to be as interesting as ever.</span></p><p><span>Also, it was rumored that the legacy version of </span><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> was already fully cast (that included Dorinda Medley and Sonja Morgan), and deals were in the process of closing. However, when asked about the details, Dorinda played coy, “I swear to you, you know as much as we do. I promise you. I’ve heard more about the new girls [on the rebooted ‘RHONY’] than I have about ‘Legacy.’ Listen, if you hear something, call me! I’ll be at Blue Stone Manor waiting, decorating for Halloween.”</span></p><p><span>Joining Jessel for the 14th installment of </span><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> were her co-stars — Sai De Silva, Erin Lichy, Jenna Lyons, Lizzy Savetsky, Ubah Hassan, and Brynn Whitfield.</span></p><p><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> is produced by Shed Media with Shannon, Lauren Volonakis, and Glenda Cox serving as executive producers.</span></p><h3><b>Jessel Taank Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Jessel Taank flaunted a net worth of about $1 million in 2022.</span></p><p><span>This fashion publicist and brand consultant started her career in public relations at </span><i><span>Karla Otto New York</span></i><span> back in Feb 2008.

The rest is history!</span></p><p><span>After three years of dating, Jessel and Pavit got engaged on their trip to Bermuda. And in October 2014, the lovebirds then finally tied the knot at Riviera Maya, Mexico. “Our intentions for dinner were simple: Drink, dance, and have a blast. And that’s exactly what happened,” Jessel recalled their wedding.</span></p><p><span>Talking more about Jessel’s husband, Pavit was born on October 23, 1979. He is the president of </span><i><span>Phone Daddy</span></i><span> and a former strategy and analytics at </span><i><span>Harbor Freight Tools</span></i><span>.

Everything you do is perfection and nothing or no one compares – because you’re simply the BEST,” the star praised her mother.</span></p><p><span>Talking about their jobs, Kishor was the Finance Manager of</span><i><span> Pentax UK Ltd</span></i><span> for over 4 decades.
