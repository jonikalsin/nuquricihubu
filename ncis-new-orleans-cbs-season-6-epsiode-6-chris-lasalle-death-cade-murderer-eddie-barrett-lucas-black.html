Throughout the season, so far, we’ve seen the story <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">focus</a> on Lasalle and his dogged determination to bring his brother Cade’s murderer(s) to justice.</p><p>But with his death, does that story also come to an end? In the episode titled ‘Matthew 5:9’, we saw Special Agent Dwayne Pride (Scott Bakula) and the rest of the team arrest a man named Eddie Barrett for the murder of Lasalle.</p><p>And even as he was being put under arrest, an unnaturally calm Barrett said, “This isn’t how this ends.” And perhaps it shouldn’t because there are many, many things about the mystery surrounding Cade’s death that remain unanswered.</p><p>First of all, we still don’t know for sure who killed Cade and why. We know he was trying to save his girlfriend’s son, Will (Wyatt Walter), from a gang that sold opioids. We saw in <a href=# rel>episode 5</a> Pride and Lasalle find the Alabama factory where a man named Stan Jenkins was manufacturing the narcotics.</p><p>But before anything could be discovered, during a skirmish between the cops and the drug manufacturers, Jenkins got killed. We also saw a man named Pual Dolan (Stephen Louis Grush) falsely confess to Cade’s murder.</p><p>But nothing pointed towards who the real murderer was and why they committed the act.&nbsp;In the sixth episode, we saw Dolan’s supposed girlfriend Sue Anne and her father Barrett (although the NCIS team found no evidence to prove they were related) try to evade arrest, if only for a little while.</p><p>Even if Barrett had murdered Lasalle, there is no way to know if he was also behind the murder of Cade. It wasn’t also clarified at any point that Barrett was the man behind the opioid operation.</p><p>And another question that needs answering is why Barrett shot Sue Anne at the cabin where Cade was allegedly killed? We also don't know what Sue Anne's angle was in the whole story. If, indeed, she wasn't Dolan's girlfriend -- The NCIS team found no digital evidence of them ever being in contact -- then what was she doing at his apartment?</p><p>There is also the question of how she is related to Barrett, if at all. And finally, did she lead Lasalle to his death? Or was that just an unlucky coincidence?&nbsp;Lasalle’s quest may have come to an inevitable end, but does that mean the mystery has been solved? Absolutely not. Hopefully, the next episode of ‘NCIS: New Orleans’ will have some answers.</p><p>‘NCIS: New Orleans’ airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoppOewG66xLBkqKqcmq6vv4ycmaxlo5qutLvNZm1mnaCotrCwxGZtZpuYp7a0ecuaqpqknJp6pbHArZ9mm5GZsm651KubnqqVp3qmsMOinGaakae%2FpsDTZqOum5GoeqO4wJyi</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./willie-spence-dead-car-accident-american-idol.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>American Idol Runner-Up Dies Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./uruena-spain.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Village That's Home To More Books Than People</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
