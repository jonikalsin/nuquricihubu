This is the story of the aviation disaster that forever changed Hughes’s personality.</p><h2>Howard Hughes Took To The Skies At An Early Age</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-361594 alt="Howard Hughes" width=465 height=640 data-sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/howard-hughes-in-1938.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-361594 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>Howard Hughes, pictured in 1938.</span></p><p>From an early age, Howard Hughes showed an interest in aviation. In fact, shortly after he moved to Los Angeles in the 1920s, he started learning how to fly planes while simultaneously investing in motion pictures. On July 14, 1938, he made history when he flew around the globe in just 91 hours. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Guardian</a>, he flew a Lockheed 14 Super Electra, a model upon which he would eventually base his own planes.</p><p>Hughes reported at the time that the plane “behaved magnificently.”</p><p>And though Howard Hughes would be involved in the investment and design of planes for both Boeing and Lockheed, his pride and joy were the planes he produced from his own line. Perhaps his most legendary craft was the “<a href=# rel=noopener>Spruce Goose,</a>” which was made of wood — and the largest aircraft of its time. Eventually, though, Hughes would add other planes to the lineup, including the Sikorsky S-43, the D-2, and the XF-11.</p><p>It was the latter plane that, unfortunately, irreparably changed Howard Hughes’ life forever.</p><h2>Inside The Beverly Hills Crash</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-361595 alt="Hughes XF-11" width=464 height=250 data-sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/howard-hughes-xf-11.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-361595 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>USAF/Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>The second Hughes XF-11 during a 1947 test flight</span></p><p>On July 7, 1946, Howard Hughes was performing the first flight of the XF-11, which was meant for the United States Army Forces. Unfortunately, the plane sprang an oil leak, which caused the propellers to reverse their pitch. As the plane began losing altitude, Hughes hoped to crash it in the Los Angeles Country Club’s golf course, but instead ended up making a fiery descent into the nearby neighborhood of Beverly Hills.</p><p>The crash destroyed three homes and the plane, and but for the quick thinking of a nearby Army major, Hughes himself would have perished in the crash.</p><p>“Hughes was saved from death as the plane exploded into flames by Marine Sgt. William Lloyd Durkin, stationed at the El Toro Marine Base, and Capt. James Guston, 22, son of the industrialist and recently released from the Army,” reported <a href=# rel=noopener>The Los Angeles Times</a>.</p><p>Hughes was horrifically injured in the crash. In addition to the third-degree burns, he suffered a crushed chest with collapsed left lung, a crushed collar bone, and multiple cracked ribs. He was confined to a bed for months, and the constant pain and struggle caused him to become dependent on opiates.</p><p>Despite his grave injuries, Hughes’s mind never stopped working, and he managed to innovate even as he recovered from the crash. Working with his own engineers, he designed a customized bed that used electric motors and buttons to move himself without pain and even dispense hot and cold water — and that design inspired the modern hospital beds we see today.</p><p>Many scholars believe that Hughes’s resulting opiate addiction is what contributed to his “eccentricity,” if not caused it altogether. The aviator became extremely germaphobic, collecting his urine in jars, and eventually refused to wear clothes altogether — although some scholars attributed this to the extreme nerve pain Hughes suffered as a result of the plane crash.</p><h2>The Legacy Of Howard Hughes’s Crash</h2><p>Though Howard Hughes was forever immortalized on celluloid thanks to the hit 2004 film The Aviator — which featured Leonardo DiCaprio in the titular role — many of his contributions to American society have been either largely forgotten, or reduced to parody thanks to being lionized by other infamous eccentrics like the late <a href=# rel=noopener>Michael Jackson.</a></p><p>Hughes had no heirs, and his estate was ultimately divided between several cousins and a woman named Terry Moore, who claimed she had married Hughes in a secret ceremony and never divorced him.</p><p>And when Hughes finally died at the age of 70 in 1976, he was in a sorry state indeed. His hair, beard, and fingernails were overgrown. He’d wasted away to 90 pounds, and hypodermic needles filled with codeine had broken off in his arms. In fact, Hughes <a href=# rel=noopener>was in such a poor state</a> that the FBI needed to use his fingerprints to properly identify his body.</p><p>But “Old Hollywood” buffs often enjoy discovering things that have a connection to the eccentric billionaire. In fact, on Dec. 19, 2021, a 6,500 square-foot home in Beverly Hills hit the market for $16 million. While much ado was made about both Wallace Neff, the architect who designed the home, and Ben Neman, the criminal who last owned it, <a href=# rel=noopener>the listing</a> didn’t hesitate to mention that this was the exact home where Howard Hughes nearly died after his infamous plane crash.</p><p>Furthermore, rumors floated for years that Hughes had not died at all in 1976, but instead lived under a second identity all the way until 2001. It seems that interest in the eccentric billionaire never truly died, after all.</p><p>Now that you’ve read all about the Howard Hughes plane crash, read all about the Michigan plane crash that left all passengers dead — except for an 11-year-old girl, who was protected by her father’s <a href=#>“bear hug.”</a> Then, take a look at a <a href=#>terrifying plane crash</a> caught from inside the cabin of the aircraft (which is not for the faint of heart).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonypu9aaqZ1lmKq0qbHSZqelmZ6aeqS%2BwKyf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-demsey-an-estee-lauder-executive-has-been-suspended-over-his-instagram-post.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Demsey An Estee Lauder Executive Has Been Suspended Over His Instagram Post</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./matrix-screen-locker.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Download Matrix Screen Locker for Windows - Free</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
