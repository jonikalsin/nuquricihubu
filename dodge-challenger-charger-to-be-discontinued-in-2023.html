These cars definitely expressed it … and were able to hold onto that essence,” said Stephanie Brinley, principal analyst at S&P Global. “Having that clear DNA and clear expression of what they’re supposed to be is helping make the transition to electric.”</p><p>Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis has alluded to the possibility that the Charger and Challenger names could be used for <a href=#>future electrified vehicles,</a> including a forthcoming electric muscle car in 2024. He’s previously said he believes electrification — whether hybrid vehicles with less powerful engines or all-electric models — will save what he has called the new <a href=#>“Golden Age of muscle cars.”</a></p><p>For several years, Kuniskis has warned that the end was coming for the gas-powered muscle cars due to emissions regulations. Dodge parent company <a href=#>Stellantis</a>, formerly Fiat Chrysler, ranks the worst among major manufacturers for U.S. corporate average fuel economy and carbon emissions.</p><p>As many brands switched to smaller and more fuel-efficient engines, Dodge rolled <a href=#>out Hellcat models</a> and other high-performance vehicles. Such models helped generate attention for the brand but didn’t help the automaker’s carbon footprint, forcing it to <a href=#>buy carbon credits</a> from automakers such as Tesla.</p><p>“The days of an iron block supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 are numbered,” Kuniskis <a href=#>previously told CNBC,</a> referring to engines like those in the Hellcat. “But the performance that those vehicles generate is not numbered.”</p><p>Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis speaks Aug. 13, 2021 during a media event. In the back, the Fratzog logo was used alongside Dodge’s current logo.</p><p>Michael Wayland / CNBC</p><p>Dodge is launching a litany of special vehicles and products to “celebrate” the end of the cars as they are today. Dodge’s plans include seven special-edition, or “buzz,” models; a commemorative “Last Call” under-hood plaque for all 2023 model-year vehicles; and a new dealer allocation process, among other measures.</p><p>The new dealer process will see Dodge allocate 2023 Charger and Challenger models to lots all at once, instead of making orders available throughout the year. Dodge will provide customers a guide to locate specific models at each dealership.</p><p>Kuniskis said the process is meant to assist customers in getting the specific vehicle they want.</p><p>“We wanted to make sure we were celebrating these cars properly,” Kuniskis said during a media briefing for an event this week in Pontiac, Michigan.</p><p>The Charger and Challenger are produced at Stellantis’ Brampton Assembly plant in Ontario, Canada. The company says it has produced more than 3 million Dodge vehicles at the plant, including 1.5 million Chargers and more than 726,000 Challengers sold in the U.S.</p><p>Stellantis earlier this year announced plans to <a href=#>invest $2.8 billion in the plant</a> and another Canadian facility, but it has not disclosed what vehicles will be produced at the facilities.</p><p>“When we shut down Brampton it will be a 20-year run of Dodge muscle cars,” Kuniskis said. “We needed to do this right.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcLDOnZ6eZZOdrq24xKeenqpdmLWivsaeqWasn2KvpnnDoqqcp56ptq%2FBxJ1koqZdZ31zf44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./felix-mallard.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Felix Mallard Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./daisy-shelton.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Daisy Shelton Cold Case Solved By Witness 60 Years After Murder</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
