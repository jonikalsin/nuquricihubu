mansion of billionaire climate investor Tom Steyer.</p><p>Biden, 80, and his scandal-plagued son Hunter, 53, <a href=#>showed up separately</a> to the six-bedroom Nevada retreat, which is touted on Redfin as “one of Lake Tahoe’s finest lakefront properties and the pinnacle waterfront estate within the gated Glenbrook community.”</p><p>The home features a “spectacular lakeside gazebo [that] rests between the park-like grounds and the calming shores of Glenbrook Bay,” the real estate website says.</p><p>The president has <a href=#>enjoyed free vacations</a> at the homes of other prominent Democrats, but the White House said that he will pay for the stay at Steyer’s three-acre property.</p><p>“The First Family is renting a private home for their stay in Lake Tahoe,” a statement read.&nbsp;“The home belongs to Tom Steyer and Kat Taylor.&nbsp;The First Family is renting the home for fair market value.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter

disclosed by the parties.</p><p>The president and first lady Jill Biden arrived in Nevada aboard Air Force One with first daughter Ashley Biden, granddaughters Maisy and Naomi, who are Hunter’s daughters, and Naomi’s husband Peter Neal.</p><p>Hunter, his wife Melissa Cohen and their 3-year-old son Beau “flew separately on a commercial flight” and were “already at the residence awaiting the rest of the family, according to the White House,” per a pool report.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">It is unclear how much the Bidens are paying to rent the multimillion-dollar Nevada manse. <span class=credit>Douglas County</span></figure><p>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said earlier this month that Republicans are moving closer to <a href=#>launching an impeachment inquiry</a> into the president’s alleged role in his son’s business ventures in countries such as China and Ukraine during the elder Biden’s vice presidency.</p><p>Hunter’s former business partner Devon Archer told the House Oversight Committee on July 31 that Joe Biden dined at least twice with his son’s Ukrainian, Russian and Kazakhstani associates, had coffee with his son’s Chinese partner in a state-backed investment fund and was put on speakerphone by Hunter during about 20 business meetings.</p><p>Hunter Biden faces a possible trial for alleged tax fraud and other crimes after a probation-only plea deal collapsed under scrutiny by a federal judge last month. Delaware US Attorney David Weiss, whose office was accused by IRS investigators of thwarting the pursuit of<a href=#> leads implicating Joe Biden,</a> was elevated to be a special counsel on Aug. 11, expanding his investigative and charging powers.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Joe and Jill Biden step off Air Force One in Reno late Friday. <span class=credit>AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Steyer’s Lake Tahoe property<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;is estimated by</a>&nbsp;Redfin to be worth $18.1 million.

They’ve never paid,” the source said.</p><p>First lady Jill Biden extended her stay on Kiawah another five days after testing positive for COVID-19.</p><p>For Thanksgiving, the extended Biden family stayed for six days at the&nbsp;<a href=#>Nantucket Island compound of billionaire investor David Rubenstein</a>, co-founder of the Carlyle Group.</p><p>The White House and a spokesperson for Rubenstein didn’t respond to inquiries about whether the Bidens paid.</p><p>In late December and early January, the first couple, their daughter Ashley and grandkids Natalie and Hunter stayed seven days for free as “guests” at the&nbsp;<a href=#>beachfront St. Croix home</a>&nbsp;of businesspeople Bill and Connie Neville.</p><p>The arrangement turned heads because the home typically is a VRBO rental and because the Nevilles gained access just weeks earlier to Biden’s first state dinner honoring French President Emmanuel Macron, joining about 300 guests including many billionaires and political and cultural powerbrokers.</p><p>Biden did not disclose any of his free vacations as president as gifts on annual disclosure forms, drawing criticism from government ethics experts who said the willful failure to report could amount to a felony.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3FmanFfl7alsc2sZK%2BZk5bBqrvNZpitZZKeua21zqeYoqqVYsGwuYysq56xlafAbn2XpmSlmZuaerWtx6icZqWRo8Cqu81o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jojospotlight.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-tuda-family-wife-children-parents-siblings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Tuda family, wife, children, parents, siblings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
