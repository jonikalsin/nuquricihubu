The pair were crossing the pond on their morning walk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Howell managed to get his son out of the water and onto the ice before sending the boy home to notify his mother, who called 911 immediately and ran to save her husband. She instructed her son to stay home as she grabbed an “anchor and rope” to help her as she ran towards the icy pond, per police.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The mother ended up falling through the ice while trying to save her husband, and she was unable to get out. Penobscot Sheriff Detective Jordan Norton was the first responder on the scene and he “began crawling across the treacherous ice, holding onto the rope, and was able to pull the mother out of ice and get her to shore.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Norton looked for Howell in the water “but could not find any trace of him,” per the release.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The mother and son were reunited at their house as an hours-long search began for Howell’s body.
