So, band them together.”</p><p>The actor went on to say that he and his girlfriend decided to keep his identity hidden at first so that fans would approach the songs with no preconceived notions about his involvement. “We chose to do it so that people would first listen to the music before dissecting the fact that we did it together,”</p><p>he explained. “[The name] sounds like an Agatha Christie character, complete with a monocle and a big mustache.”</p><h3>2022, August</h3><p>“Taylor and Joe have the best of both worlds right now,” a source told Us exclusively of the couple’s romance. “They enjoy splitting their time between England and Nashville, and that is how they both prefer it.”</p><p>“It became clear to both of them that they were happiest doing their own thing in a low-key way from the moment they started dating,” the insider said, adding, “that was a big reason why they bonded.”</p><p>The couple, who have been together for more than five years, “are wildly happy together and are excited about their future together,” according to the source.</p><h3>2022, October</h3><p>Swift’s relationship with Alwyn was thrust back into the spotlight with<a href=#> the release of her tenth studio album, Midnights.</a> Not only did the actor co-write “Sweet Nothing,” but the “Maroon” singer-songwriter also sang about engagement rumors on “Lavender Haze.”</p><p>Swift sings in the song, “All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me) / Is if I’m going to be your bride.” “The only type of girl they see (the only type of girl they see) / Is a one-night stand or a wife.”</p><p><span style=font-size:12pt><strong>Read More:</strong></span></p><ul><li><a href=#>Who Is Reign Judge Boyfriend 2022?
