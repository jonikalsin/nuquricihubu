Camp was born on the 4th October 1978, in Calgary, Alberta Canada, and is a software developer and entrepreneur, famously known to have co-founded StumbleUpon and Uber.</p><p>So just how rich is Garrett Camp? Camp’s net worth as of early 2016 is reported by sources to be over $6.6 billion, coming from his businesses and various investments in other companies, and making him one of the top 30 richest people in the world.</p><p>Growing up in Calgary, Camp attended a small school during his elementary and high school years. He then enrolled in the University of Calgary in 1996 , to study electrical engineering. During his junior year, he also had his internship at Nortel Networks in Montreal, then moved back to Calgary in 2000 to finish his degree.</p><h3>Garrett Camp Net Worth $6.6 Billion</h3><p>While attending the university, Camp and his friends decided that they wanted to open their own business. Camp along with Geoff Smith, Justin LaFrance and Eric Boyd created a discovery engine designed to give personalized suggestions to its users, thus the birth of “StumbleUpon”. It helps people find specific sites suited to their interests and needs, giving it a more advanced edge than a regular search engine that people are used to. His net worth was rising already.</p><p>The application became successful and its unprecedented growth attracted the attention of some Silicon Valley investors. In 2006, the team moved its headquarters to San Francisco after receiving support from Silicon Valley investors, and in 2007, StumbleUpon was sold to eBay for $75 million, considerably raising Camp’s net worth. In 2009, Camp bought back the company and served as its CEO, until he decided to step down in 2012. StumbleUpon acquired 25 million users in the span of ten years and has been listed as one of Time Magazines 50 best websites.</p><p>While still sitting as the CEO of StumbleUpon, Camp partnered with <a href=#>Travis Kalanick</a> to develop a new application subsequently called “UberCab”. Camp and <a href=#>Kalanick</a> along with <a href=#>Ryan Graves</a>, Oscar Salazar, and Conrad Whelan designed and developed the application’s early prototype, later to be known as “Uber”, a transportation network company which works as a ‘phone application enabling customers or passengers to make a trip request, and a driver will respond if they can accommodate the request, all done by ‘phones.</p><p>In 2010, the team launched Uber with several cars in San Francisco. From a seed money of $200,000 the company is now worth $50 billion, and has grown to now be operating in 58 countries, another successful wing in Camp’s resume, and comprising a huge part of his net worth.</p><p>Garrett Camp started another project in 2013 called “Expa”, the goal of which is to help up and coming businessmen to develop their products, and assist them to launch it to the public. Camp’s new company attracted investors from huge companies like Google, TPG, Virgin, and WordPress to name a few. By 2014 it had raised a total of $50 million from its investors.</p><p>As someone who began in a startup company of his own, today Camp also gives back by helping out and investing in other startup companies such as Prism Skylabs, SoundTracking, WillCall and PSDept.</p><p>In his personal life, Garrett keeps it very private, and little is known outside of his business interests.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqCYq6qVqcFur8Cmp2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marcel-sabitzer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marcel Sabitzer- Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./selena-gomez-sister-gracie-olivia-rodrigo-concert-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Selena Gomez &amp;amp; Little Sister Gracie Sing At Olivia Rodrigo Concert Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
