He is most famous for being the lead singer of the Nu-Metal band Limp Bizkit, which is considered one of the pioneers of the genre.</p><p>Durst has also ventured into film, starring in several movies and directing others.</p><p>His career has made him a respected figure in both the music and film industries, and his net worth reflects his success.</p><h2><span id=Fred_Dursts_Childhood_and_Early_Career>Fred Durst’s Childhood and Early Career</span></h2><p>Fred Durst was born on August 20th, 1970 in Jacksonville, Florida. He grew up on a farm until fifth grade, and then moved with his family to Gastonia, North Carolina where he attended high school. Durst was raised as a Wiccan throughout his childhood.</p><p>By the age of 12, Durst had developed a passion for hip hop culture and learned various skills such as breakdancing, rapping, skateboarding, beatboxing, and deejaying. He was also fascinated by heavy metal and punk rock.</p><p>After high school, Durst joined the US Navy but left after two years. He then worked as a landscaper and tattoo artist in Jacksonville, where he started playing with the idea of creating a band that combined hip hop and rock into one genre.</p><h2><span id=Limp_Bizkits_Rise_to_Prominence>Limp Bizkit’s Rise to Prominence</span></h2><p>In 1994, Fred Durst teamed up with Sam Rivers, John Otto, and Wes Borland, becoming Limp Bizkit. They chose the name to discourage people from listening to their music. Early hits like “Straight Up” started to blow up in the underground scene. Korn signed Limp Bizkit to their label after Durst showed them some demo tapes. After releasing “Three Dollar Bill, Y’all,” Durst became the Senior Vice President of A&R at Interscope Records and started to collaborate with other groups.</p><p>The release of “Significant Other” in 1999 turned Limp Bizkit into a popular band. “Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water” in 2000 was one of the most influential albums of the late 90s. Limp Bizkit embarked on lengthy tours, but there were instances of violence and sexual assault during their performances, particularly at Woodstock in 1999. Durst was a strong advocate of file sharing and one of the band’s tours was sponsored by Napster.</p><p>After going on hiatus, Durst focused on a filmmaking career, starring in “Population 436” and directing “The Education of Charlie Banks” and “The Longshots.” Limp Bizkit got back together in 2009 and spent the next few years touring with a number of bands. In 2018, Durst started directing “The Fanatic,” which starred John Travolta.</p><h2><span id=Fred_Dursts_Personal_Life>Fred Durst’s Personal Life</span></h2><p>Fred Durst was married to Rachel Tergesen, with whom he had one child in 1990. He also has another child with ex-girlfriend Jennifer Thayer. Durst’s second wife was Esther Nazarov, but they separated just three months after their 2009 marriage. In 2012, Durst married Kseniya Beryazina, but they filed for divorce in 2018.</p><h2><span id=Fred_Dursts_Controversial_Comments_and_Feuds>Fred Durst’s Controversial Comments and Feuds</span></h2><p>Fred Durst has been involved in a number of controversies over the years, including his efforts to obtain a Russian passport and his positive comments about Vladimir Putin, which led to him being barred from entering Ukraine. The sale of all Limp Bizkit music and merchandise was also banned in Ukraine.</p><p>Durst has not been afraid to express his distaste for other musical artists, including Slipknot, whom he referred to as “fat” and “ugly” in 1999. He also started a long-running feud with the band Placebo and encouraged crowd members to chant “Placebo sucks” before the group came on stage.</p><p>Despite being friends with Eminem, Durst criticized him after he started a feud with Everlast. In response, Eminem released the Fred Durst diss track “Girls” in 2001. In 2018, Shaggy 2 Dope of the Insane Clown Posse attempted to dropkick Durst while he was on stage, which Durst called a “clout chaser.”</p><h2><span id=Fred_Dursts_Real_Estate_Ventures>Fred Durst’s Real Estate Ventures</span></h2><p>In 2015, Fred Durst put his Hollywood Hills property on the market for $1.645 million, just a year after purchasing it for $1.5 million. The 1920s property boasted over 3,000 square feet of living space and a wine cellar.</p><p>In 2018, Fred suffered a loss when his California house was destroyed in wildfires, resulting in the loss of many valuable possessions and sound recording equipment.</p><p>However, in July 2021, Fred made a new real estate investment with the purchase of a $3 million home in West Hollywood, California.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCy0Z6bZpylp8C1ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jiri-fischer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jiri Fischer Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dominic-rains.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dominic Rains Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
