Winks also had an older brother, Leo Martindale, who joined the US Army but died at the age of 75 on the 11th of March 2003.

His newfound success enabled Wink to establish his own company, Wink Martindale Enterprises.</p><p>The first show to come out of the newly formed Martindale Enterprises was&nbsp;Headline Chasers.&nbsp;The series didn’t enjoy much success and was replaced by&nbsp;Bumper Stumpers. Wink continued to make TV shows and was the host behind, Trivial Pursuit, Jumble, and Boggle.</p><p>Wink’s highest-rated TV show was the 1996’s game show, Debt.

Some of them are related to his career, while others are more personal. Here are some of the most notable ones:</p><p><strong>Rigging the outcomes of Tic-Tac-Dough</strong>: One of the earliest rumors about Martindale was that he was involved in rigging the outcomes of his game shows, especially Tic-Tac-Dough. The show, which aired from 1978 to 1985, featured a tic-tac-toe board with nine categories of questions. The contestants had to answer correctly to place their X or O on the board and win cash prizes. However, some viewers suspected that the questions were manipulated to favor certain contestants or create more drama. For instance, in 1980, a contestant named Thom McKee won 43 consecutive games and amassed over $300,000 in winnings, setting a record for the longest winning streak on a game show at the time. Some critics accused Martindale of giving McKee easier questions or letting him choose his preferred categories more often than his opponents. Martindale dismissed the accusations and said that McKee was simply a very smart and lucky player who knew how to play the game well.</p><p><strong>Cancelation of Debt</strong>: A more serious controversy that affected Martindale was the cancellation of his show Debt in 1998. The show, which premiered in 1996, featured contestants who had to answer trivia questions to pay off their debts. The show was praised for its originality and humor, but it also faced criticism for exploiting the financial woes of its contestants and making light of a serious social issue. Some advertisers pulled out of the show, citing ethical concerns or low ratings.</p><p><strong>The friendly feud with Chuck Woolery and Gene Rayburn</strong>: Wink Martindale had a long-standing rivalry with fellow game show hosts Chuck Woolery and Gene Rayburn, who gave him the nickname of “Stink Fartindale” as a joke.&nbsp;The three of them would often tease each other on air and off air, but they also respected each other as professionals and friends.</p><p><strong>The Elvis Presley connection</strong>: Wink Martindale was one of the first DJs to play Elvis Presley’s music on the radio, and he witnessed his rise to fame firsthand. On July 10, 1954, he was showing the WHBQ studio to some friends when he realized that his colleague Dewey Phillips was getting a lot of reactions from listeners after airing a new song by Presley called “That’s All Right”.&nbsp;Martindale rushed to the studio and interviewed Presley on air, becoming one of the first people to do so. Martindale and his wife Sandy did not attend the funeral of his longtime friend Elvis Presley when the singer died on August 16, 1977. They did not want to be a part of the circus-like atmosphere surrounding the event.&nbsp;Instead, they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">visited </a>Graceland a week later and paid their respects privately.</p><p><strong>His futuristic documentary film about home life in 1999</strong>: In 1967, Martindale acted in a short futuristic documentary film about home life in the year 1999 produced by the Philco-Ford Corporation. The film was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">titled</a>&nbsp;1999 A.D.&nbsp;and it featured a nuclear family living in a modular home with a central computer that controlled various aspects of their daily life, such as health monitoring, education, cooking, and shopping.&nbsp; The film has been widely circulated on the Internet as an example of how some predictions came true while others did not.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal life</h2><p id=7>Wink Martindale is a devoted family man, who has been married twice and has four children. Wink’s first wife was&nbsp;Madelyn Leech, whom he married in 1954 when he was just 21 years old. They had four children together:&nbsp;Wink Jr., Lisa, Lynn, and Laura.

Sandy is the daughter of John Ferra, a music producer who worked with Elvis Presley. Wink and Sandy have been married for 48 years now, and they are still very much in love. They have no children of their own, but they have been supportive of Wink’s children from his previous marriage.</p><p>Wink and Sandy are also involved in charity work, especially for children’s causes.
