The docu-soap on the streaming network follows the personal and professional lives of The Oppenheim Group's fashionable and sophisticated female real estate agents. Along with business deals and client meetings, the reality drama frequently includes tittle-tattle that might be exaggerated.</p><p>The seventh season of Selling Sunset aired on Netflix on November 3, 2023. And you may remember <strong>Romain Bonnet</strong> from Selling Sunset, who is a model and French reality TV star located in the United States. With his rise in fame, fans have wondered about his age.</p><p>Previously, we talked about <a href=#><strong>Emma Hernan</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Maya Vander</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Chrishell Stause</strong></a>!</p><h2>Romain Bonnet From Selling Sunset Is in His 30 Born on June 18, 1993!</h2><p>You may have remembered the discussion regarding <strong>Romain Bonnet</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@theromainbonnet</a>) and <strong>Mary</strong>'s <a href=# rel=noopener>age differences</a> in the show. Selling Sunset's Bonnet has appeared on the show since its inception. In the first episode of the Netflix reality show, he was <a href=# rel=noopener>introduced</a> to us as Mary Fitzgerald's hot, younger boyfriend.

Their love story began when he flew to Los Angeles, California, in search of a home, Mary was his agent, and they hit it off right away. However, many people were struck by how much younger Romain is than Mary, noting that the Netflix star's partner is just roughly four years older than her son, <strong>Austin Babbitt</strong>.</p><p>Mary is thirteen years older than Romain, who is in his 30s. However, it is clear that they do not regard their age difference as a reason to be concerned about their relationship. After all, who can forget his touching proposal to Mary, which we witnessed at the end of season 1 of 'Selling Sunset? Interestingly, the pair had already been legally married when Bonnet proposed on-screen, though the specifics were revealed much later.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/11/how-old-is-romain-selling-sunset-2.jpg alt="Romain Bonnet is thirteen years younger than Mary. celebsindepth.com" width=576 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Romain Bonnet is thirteen years younger than Mary.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>As it turns out, Mary and Romain married on March 9, 2018, at the Ventura Courthouse, some 19 months before the grandiose wedding on October 12, 2019. However, the couple had their reasons for doing things in this particular way.The couple's time on the show has been consistent over the years. Their marriage appears to be as strong as ever. The couple's journey in Season 7 of the program was not easy to watch, yet they withstood the anguish while sticking by each other.</p><p>Nonetheless, the pair experiences problems, such as his desire to have children and Mary's reluctance to restart her parenting journey. Mary gave birth to her son, Austin Babbitt, when she was only 16 years old. She did, however, reveal that she was open to having children with him and had frozen her eggs. They discovered they were pregnant at the start of the season.</p><p>Fans of the program are probably aware that they have long desired to have children. As a result, Mary's unexpected pregnancy was very wonderful news. However, she and Bonnet found she had miscarried nine weeks later when their doctor couldn't find a heartbeat during a scheduled ultrasound check.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGifqK9dpLmlecisZKunnZa2r3nSnqOloZ6cerTBzaycrWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mattybraps.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>MattyB bio, career, Relationship, Girlfriend, affairs, Net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./harper-beckham.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Harper Beckham-Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
