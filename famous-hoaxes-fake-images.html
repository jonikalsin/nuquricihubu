Wells’ novel The War of the Worlds — staged as if it was an actual radio report of an alien invasion in progress — created a nationwide panic.</p><p>In between bouts of music, various “breaking news” announcements reported visible explosions on Mars, then a spaceship landing in Grover’s Mill, New Jersey, and finally Martians terrorizing New Jersey and New York City.</p><p>Stricken with fear, New Jersey locals went into a panic, with some even packing the highways to make an escape.</p><p>Two-thirds of the way through the broadcast, the intermission announcement reminded listeners that the broadcast was fictional, but the damage was done.</p><p>Although it was never intended to be a hoax at all, the resulting panic led “The War of the Worlds” broadcast to become one of history’s most famous hoaxes.</p><h2>Edward Mordake</h2><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-79716 alt="Edward Mordrake" width=900 height=758 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/edward-mordrake.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-79716 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Twitter</span><span class=caption-body>The photo — actually of a wax construction of what Edward Mordrake might have looked like — that set the Internet abuzz.</span></p><p>An old hoax that is only growing more famous thanks to the Internet and American Horror Story: Freak Show is the curious case of Edward Mordake.</p><p>The story goes that Mordake was born into a noble bloodline but suffered from a horrid congenital deformity: a second face on the back of his head.</p><p>He claimed it would whisper hateful, evil things to him while he slept. Mordrake begged doctors to have it removed, but that never happened and, unable to live with the relentless sneering from his parasitic twin, he committed suicide at the age of 23.</p><p>Different versions of Mordrake’s story have since been featured in plays, television, and music (Tom Wait’s song “Poor Edward”) — and many of these retellings present Mordrake as a real man. His case even appeared in an 1896 medical journal.</p><p>But, although there have been real cases of this rare deformity, Mordrake’s story was instead a hoax created by science fiction writer Charles Hildreth in 1895. And as for the picture of the “real” Edward Mordake that has recently been floating around the Internet, it’s actually just a wax replica portraying what Mordake might have looked like.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonynrcyorKxlmKSuubHSZp2ao5Vitq6txp6q</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./whitney-houston-parents-4987123.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything To Know Her Mom &amp;amp; Dad Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./of-erin-brockovich-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Of Erin Brockovich Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
