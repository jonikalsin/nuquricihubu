She notably played Cassie Lang in the first two&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ant-Man</a>&nbsp;films.&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rachel McAdams</a>&nbsp;</strong>and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Benny Safdie</strong></a> star as Margaret’s parents, Barbara (who is Christian) and Herb (who is Jewish).&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kathy Bates</a>&nbsp;</strong>stars as Margaret’s grandmother, Sylvia.

She’s also a producer with others including Judy and James L. Brooks, who she previously worked with on the 2016 film&nbsp;The Edge of Seventeen. Other producers include <strong>Richard Sakai</strong>, <strong>Amy Brooks</strong>, and <strong>Julie Ansel</strong>. The crew is also made up of editors <strong>Oona Flaherty</strong> and <strong>Nick Moore</strong>, cinematographer <strong>Tom Ives</strong>, and music composer <strong>Hans Zimmer</strong>. Gracie Films produced the movie and Lionsgate is the distributor.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In an interview with<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>, Kelly reflected on when Judy agreed to surrender the rights to her book so a movie could be made. “She was very nervous that someone would turn the film into something very glossy and pretty, where all the edges were sanded off,” Kelly shared. “When I sat down with her, she had just seen my first film, The Edge of Seventeen, and she expressed that that made her feel confident that I was going to embrace all the flaws and nuances. That gave her confidence that the film would have the same honesty that she is so known for.”</p><h2>How Close Will the Film Be to the Novel?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Kelly explained to&nbsp;EW&nbsp;why she kept the movie in the same era with the same story as Judy’s novel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“While certain details have changed over the years, the experience of growing up is really universal,” she said. “It’s the same across the decades. There’s something about an 11-year-old or 12-year-old girl today, watching a girl in 1970 go through the exact same experience that she’s going through today. It feels so comforting to know that you’re part of a long lineage. It takes that ‘you’re not alone’ feeling and multiplies it exponentially. Because everyone every year before you has gone through this, and [they will] every year after.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Rachel McAdams told&nbsp;THR that she has high hopes for the lessons that this movie can teach. “I hope there’s, above all, a feeling of togetherness and community and feeling, as women, like we’re all on the same team,” she explained. “That there’s nothing you can’t talk about with each other.&nbsp;And for men, too.” Rachel also said, “Movies are such a great way to get the ball rolling at the dinner table. I hope that it fosters conversation and a feeling of not being alone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CrnGaxn6p6tbTEq5xmn5%2BZeqrA0maknmWdlr%2BordGeq2aln6u2pnmUaWduaGVtfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-evan-winiker-5064654.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Evan Winiker? 5 Things On Lana Del Reys Reported New Fiance Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-tyson-reveals-a-surprising-encounter-walking-in-on-brad-pitt-with-his-ex-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Tyson Reveals a Surprising Encounter: Walking In on Brad Pitt with His Ex-Wife</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tyler-mcghin-accident-death-family-crash-details.html>Lakeland: Tyler Mcghin Accident Linked To Death Family And Crash Details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-quick.html>Taylor Quick- Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chima-ferguson.html>Chima Ferguson</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kym-karath.html>Kym Karath</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-official-pizza-of-the-nfl.html>What is the official pizza of the NFL?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog.
