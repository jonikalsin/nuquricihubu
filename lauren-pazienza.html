According to reports, the police received a tip that Pazienza was hiding out at her parent’s house, where her father stated that she was not there and did not consent to the search of the property.</p><p>She has not revealed about her family member and educational background.</p><h2><span id=Lauren_Pazienza_8211_Professional_Career>Lauren Pazienza – Professional Career</span></h2><p>Pazienza worked in a variety of marketing and communication positions. She was working in a range of roles in marketing and communication, according to her now-defunct LinkedIn page. She worked for luxury goods and jewelry enterprises, where she held the job of marketing and events coordinator.

The police have acquired video surveillance of the suspect at the subway.
