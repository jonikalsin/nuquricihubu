The most exciting however will only be Kaley taking on the recurring role of Cade in Fox medical drama, The Resident.</p><p>Read the full article to know about Kaley’s role on The Resident. Also, get to know about Kaley’s net worth, family members, marital status, and more.</p><h3><strong>Kaley Ronayne On The Resident</strong></h3><p>While The Resident viewers, Fox medical drama, are still heartbroken by the exit of Nicolette Nevin (played by Emily VanCamp) from the show, the Chastain Park Memorial is getting a new doctor, Cade, which will be played by, of course, Kaley Ronayne.</p><p>The role of Cade has been described as a badass emergency room doctor, an “action heroine”. Cade is a daredevil and a rational problem-solver. Strong and athletic, Cade is not the one to play games– she takes no prisoners and also has a no-nonsense empathy approach toward her patients.</p><p>As the co-showrunner Peter Elkoff told the TVLine, Cade will have large screentime in the second half of Season 5. Cade has also been described as someone with a mysterious past, so most likely there will be a lot of stories to tell about her.</p><h3><strong>Is Kaley Ronayne Married?</strong></h3><p>Coming to Kaley Ronayne’s personal life, we know that she dated a man named Dave Coleman in the past. While we don’t know when they first met each other, their earliest post on Instagram was made on October 8, 2016. The post was made by Dave and it was a recent picture of the pair in Comicon.</p><p>The lovebirds had their 3rd dating anniversary on July 26, 2018, which means they were already in a relationship by August 2015. On January 3, 2019, Dave uploaded a picture of them on his Instagram and put a somewhat reflective piece of their relationship and life in general in the caption.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kaley-Ronayne-260x300.jpg><p>However, that was the last time they ever uploaded pictures of one another. That makes it difficult for us to say if Kaley is still together with Dave or not.</p><p>That being said, Kaley uploaded a picture of herself carrying a bottle of wine on Valentine’s 2021. That is why there’s also a possibility that Kaley is with a new man altogether.</p><h3><strong>Kaley Ronayne Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in the year 1990, Kaley Ronayne’s age was 31 as of October 2021.
